# Notes
Rather than removing the barrel, I tried to fix what people might consider bad behavior from the barrel. The random rotation and position are removed and the barrel won't give you a second lease on life. Players will not be able to sit in the barrel and will have no choice in being blasted out immediately.

The barrel blast strength has been upped enough to kill every character off the top of the screen. If you have a teammate, however, they might be able to save you.

This stage is primarily meant for 2v2 gameplay.

# Current Changes
* Barrel does not move
* Barrel positioned underneath center of stage
* Barrel releases characters instantly upon capturing them
* Barrel deals 30% when releasing a character
* Barrel will throw all characters far enough to kill them off the top
* Side platforms lowered by 20 units
* Lowered camera bounds by 20 units in order to better accomodate teams

# To-do
* Fix erratic barrel behavior after 9 minute mark
* Change lighting to make characters more visible on-stage
* More testing...
