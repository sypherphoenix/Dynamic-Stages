# Notes
Done at the request of PGH Carroll. This stage is relatively simple. When platforms are moving fast enough, it becomes really obvious that they don't obey normal physics. Jumping from a moving platform will have your character move straight up relative to the stage rather than platform. 

There are probably some nuggets of interesting gameplay here, but I am personally looking for more dramatic changes. Given that a few other people have released stages with similar platform movement ideas, I think it's unlikely that I'll clean up this stage further.

# To-do
* Create retired stages directory on github?
