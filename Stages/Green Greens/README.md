# Notes
This stage is really fun. The strategies used on this stage are pretty different from other stages, even though there aren't really any novel features. The ledges have small slopes, so there are some interesting momentum tricks here. The blast height is even lower than Yoshi's Story, but without a top platform, it doesn't feel like it. The side blastzones are unchanged from the vanilla stage, so many characters can still utilize their recoveries.

# Current Changes
* Side stage elements moved off-screen. Corresponding collision removed.
* Blocks & wind disabled.
* Blast height: 197 -> 222
* Camera height: 126 -> 142
* Camera zoom minimum: 83 -> 124
* P3 spawn position: (-100,-3) -> (40,42)
* P4 spawn position: (100,-3) -> (-40,42)
* Lower wall collision points moved in slightly to prevent C.Falcon's IWJ
	* (±59,-25) -> (±57.5,-25)
	* (±55,-40.5) -> (±54,-40.5)


# To-do
* More testing for full release
* Create Gecko implementation of this stage.
