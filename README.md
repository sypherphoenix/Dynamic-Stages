# More Dynamic Melee Stages

### What This Is
This is a collection of stage modifications I have created for *Super Smash Bros. Melee*. They are designed with competitive gameplay in mind. To use this repository and play on these stages, see **Installation**.

### Who I Am
I have been playing Melee in tournaments since 2007, and have been organizing tournaments that entire time as well. I am interested in exploring the design space of competitive Melee and platform fighters, and also game design in general. Stages have interested me greatly for most of my time as a competitive player. 

### Why This Exists
Nearly all the stages players compete on are extremely simple and have several key features in common; this is contrast to the great diversity of stages included in any *Super Smash Bros.* game, let alone all the unexplored possibilities. 20XX, PM, and other community mods have brought many new stages to Melee-like environments, but they are extremely conservative in their design, and players do not need to alter their strategy much (or at all) to play successfully on them. I am tired of playing on Battlefield clones.



# Design Philosophy

### Stages
Stages are the medium through which characters in the game interact. There are no inherently good or bad stages.

### My Stages
My stages attempt to reduce unfun situations, and to create more fun situations.

### Randomness
When most players describe randomness in stages, they are actually talking about *chaoticness* or *chaos*. Even if a stage element operates predictably, it may still interfere with other elements of the match at unknowable times. If players cannot predict the future state of the game well enough, they cannot strategize about it, and so their gameplay is randomly interfered with.

### Chaos
Players prefer some level of chaos; it is a main selling point of Melee. Increasing the level of chaos can increase the fun as well. This should be done carefully so that players can always parse what their next decision should be.

### Static & Dynamic Stage Elements
When players think about stage elements, they generally only consider static ones. However, nearly all stage elements can be made dynamic. By making different stage elements dynamic, we can create more varied stages and increase the chaos of those stages.

### Limiting Factors in *Melee*
* Circle Camping
* Fox Shine Infinites
* Ledge Camping
* Jigglypuff Air Camping
* Top Platform Camping
* Trivial Top Blastzone Kill Setups

### Things We Are Not Limited By
* Moving Platforms
* Slopes
* Stage Hitboxes / Hurtboxes
* Walls, Generally
* Unique Stage Mechanics
* The Performance of Inflexible Characters (i.e. Low-Tiers)
